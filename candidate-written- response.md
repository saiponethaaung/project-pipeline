## Candidate written response

Name: Sai Pone Tha Aung<br/><br/>

I think the exam is good. To be honest, I don't face any challenges as I am already familiar with working those kinds of workflow.<br/>
Due to the time constraint, I cannot improvise a lot of things.<br/><br/>

If there is no time limit, I will add task name, task priority(agile/scrum point based on the Fibonacci system for their difficulty), and task description.<br/>
In real-world usage, we will need a description of the task so I will add the task description to make it usable at least.
